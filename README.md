This is the code for my portfolio website, created using node, express, and react. All work is my own unless specified below:

Instead of using create-react-app, I opted to create it from scratch with guidance from [this tutorial](https://dev.to/ivadyhabimana/how-to-create-a-react-app-without-using-create-react-app-a-step-by-step-guide-30nl). I did this to avoid adding clutter/unnecessary features, and to gain a greater understanding of the components.  
I used code from [this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/gltf-simple-example-v44gg?file=/src/styles.css:33-133) as a baseline to display my torso model with r3f, all further tweaks and changes were made by me.
