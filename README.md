# andrewyur.github.io

This is the code for my portfolio website, created using node, express, and react. All work and assets are my own unless specified below:

Instead of using create-react-app, I opted to create it from scratch with guidance from [this tutorial](https://dev.to/ivadyhabimana/how-to-create-a-react-app-without-using-create-react-app-a-step-by-step-guide-30nl). I did this to avoid adding clutter/unnecessary features, and to gain a greater understanding of the components.  
I used code from [this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/gltf-simple-example-v44gg?file=/src/styles.css:33-133) as a baseline to display my torso model with r3f, all further tweaks and changes were made by me.


// TODO:
// pick out specific aspect from inspirations to recreate

// TOOLS:
// greenstack animation library

// INSPIRATIONS:
// https://jonasemmertsen.com/ - quiet and subtle text animations that are reused throughout the site
// https://mathijshanenkamp.com/ - simple and quiet minimalistic theme and typography
// https://www.deso.com/ - scroll based animations, idle animations in 3d scene, passive mouse movement interactions
//      good transition from 3d scene to solid background, good typeface, good buttons/cta, grain mask (shouldn't be over background)
// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJBNQeSR8LQ - shader (<3 <3) could work in three.js
// https://seed.com/ - interesting thematic background footage mixed with simple emphasis hero
// https://monopo.nyc/ - sideways scroll, passive interactive hero
// https://monopo.london/ - interactive background with filters
// https://monopo.co.jp/ - scroll animations start on first scroll input, only depend on scroll for start
// https://lunchbox.io/ - contained grain/filter, distinct theme and color, tiny floating little doodles
// https://www.richardekwonye.com/ - big text, good pictures/assets
// https://dennissnellenberg.com/ - bouncy animations, fast at start and scroll and steady after that
// https://www.guillaumetomasi.com/ - mouse filter, auto cycle on idle
